# DesmosWaifuRendering


An attempt to render raster images in Desmos. This is a simpler version of [DesmosBezierRenderer](https://github.com/kevinjycui/DesmosBezierRenderer)
as the latter was not working very well.


```
List of dependencies

- numpy
- matplotlib
- opencv-python
- Flask
- Flask_cors
```

Put the image that you want to render inside the image directory and run main.py

```python
python main.py
```
Then open the index.html file in any web browser and the image should be rendered within few seconds.
